You might be getting weird graphical glitches, especially on the HTML5 platform. Clearing the asset compiler cache may sometimes fix these issues.

In GMS2, you can clear the cache by pressing this button:

![Clear Cache](/assets/gms2_cache_clear.jpg)

In GMS1, the cache can be cleared with this button:

![Clear Cache](/assets/gms1_cache_clear.jpg)

Compile your game again after clearing the cache. If that doesn't fix your issue, it's probably something else.
