Here are some things you can do to start making games in GameMaker:
- Read the manual
- Look for beginner tutorials on YouTube
- Play around with the program
- Buy a beginner course on Udemy

Do note that your first few games will definitely not be *great*, especially if it is your first time using any game engine. So just focus on making *something*, and learning how the engine works (and how coding works, if you're new to it).
