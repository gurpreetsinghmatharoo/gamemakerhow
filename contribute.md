# Rules

To make sure that our questions stay consistent, I've set up some rules:

- Question must be one-liner
- Answer must not exceed 100 words, or 150 at most
- Answer may contain a code example
- Answer may contain a link to a tutorial


# Contact

You can send me your question and answer pair (along with any example code) through this contact form.
I will email you back if I need more details and to confirm the addition of your contribution.
